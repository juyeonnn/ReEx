## Prompt Template for evaluating revision task based on NLI
## Adapted from the paper: Evaluating the Logical Reasoning Ability of ChatGPT and GPT-4 (Liu, Hanmeng, et al. 2023)

## We use NLI to determine if the revised response corrects or preserves facts.
# - Correction Accuracy: Measures the ratio of corrected fact units that were incorrectly stated initially.
# - Revision Accuracy: Measures the ratio of correct fact units in the revised response.

## Code Example:
# rev_label = []
# for n_idx, nli in enumerate(nli_result):
#     if nli == 'e' and gt_label[n_idx]:
#         rev_label.append(True)  # Right preserved
#     elif nli in ['c', 'n'] and gt_label[n_idx]:
#         rev_label.append(False)  # Wrong corrected
#     elif nli == 'e' and not gt_label[n_idx]:
#         rev_label.append(False)  # Wrong preserved
#     elif nli in ['c', 'n'] and not gt_label[n_idx]:
#         rev_label.append(True)  # Right corrected
#     else:
#         rev_label.append(True)  # Default case

# # Calculate accuracy metrics
# true_idx = [j for j, x in enumerate(gt_label) if x]
# false_idx = [j for j, x in enumerate(gt_label) if not x]

# gt_label_true = [gt_label[j] for j in true_idx]
# rev_label_true = [rev_label[j] for j in true_idx]
# gt_label_false = [gt_label[j] for j in false_idx]
# rev_label_false = [rev_label[j] for j in false_idx]

# correction_accuracy = sum(rev_label_false) / len(rev_label_false) 
# revision_accuracy = sum(rev_label) / len(rev_label)

  You will be presented with a premise and a hypothesis about that premise. 
  You need to decide whether the hypothesis is entailed by the premise by choosing one of the following answers: 
  ’e’: The hypothesis follows logically from the information contained in the premise. 
  ’c’: The hypothesis is logically false from the information contained in the premise. 
  ’n’: It is not possible to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false without further information. 
  Read the passage of information thoroughly and select the correct answer from the three answer labels. 
  Read the premise thoroughly to ensure you know what the premise entails.
  
  Premise: {input} {premise}

  Hypothesis: {hypothesis}
